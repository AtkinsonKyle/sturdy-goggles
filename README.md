# Travel Goggles

I travel frequently to different states and countries. My mission creating this repo is to give my family and others recommendations to a variety of attractions, restaurants, and hotels on their travels.

07/05: Created repository
07/07: Structured homepage with title, head, navbar, footer, and header. Added 4 states: WA, FL, NC, and CA. Created JS and Styles folders. Washington page up. Styled homepage.
Hurdled Problem: Figured out how to use CSS Grid to create two columns for the homepage.
